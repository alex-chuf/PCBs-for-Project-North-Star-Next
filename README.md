This USB3 Hub board is specially used on some AR/VR DIY project, that requires: 

-less cable connect to the host machine
-need to connect at least 2 USB camera sensors, or other sensors that work on USB2 or USB3
-keep the USB3 hub size as small as possible 


Why do you need it? 

I recently worked on an AR project called project north star. I found there was an issue with connecting the sensors to the host , normally we will use at least 2 camera sensor (e.g. Ultraleap IR170, Intelrealsense T261/T265), these sensors can both work on USB2 and USB3. You may connect them to a cheap and small size USB2 hub, but the problem is, there is no enough bandwidth to support two sensors on a same USB2 hub. You will face laggy and latency issues. 

So I made this USB3 hub, with features: 
-Small size, so you can easily put into your headset
-4x USB 3 downstream ports, support both USB2 and USB3
-up to 5Gbit/s USB3 bandwidth, more than enough to support even three USB3 sensors at the same time
-USB3 type C cable input
-A cooling fan connector
-An exposed soldering pad for 5V and GND, so you can possibly power other devices from it.
Note: normally the host machine can output 5V/1A power on the USB3 port.
